# Loan Default Prediction

## 📌 Objective
This repository contains the solution for Task 2 of the Data Science & Analytics Internship
at DevelopersHub Corporation. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict
whether a loan applicant will default based on historical loan application data.

## 🧠 Approach
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Handled missing values and cleaned the data
- Encoded categorical features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📊 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 78.8% on the test dataset.  
The confusion matrix shows how well the model distinguishes approved vs rejected loans.
